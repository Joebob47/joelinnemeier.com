      Jica doesn't particularly like sleeping in her crate. When we first adopted her, we tried to get her comfortable. But, everytime we closed the crate door, she would yelp and claw loudly.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually, we couldn't bear her suffering any longer, and gave up on the crate training entirely, allowing her to decide for herself where she would be sleeping.

    <p>
    Her final decision moved her out of our room and into the living room (perhaps the furthest spot from her crate possible). Now, She stays in the living room, usually on top of a couch blanket. She has a habit of scrunching up the blanket with her paws to make a lump comfortable enough for her to sink into, so she can <em>really</em> relax. <br><br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What a comfy spot she's made for herself here!

      Then, invariably, around 5 AM she'll jump into bed with us, ocassionally startling me awake in the process! She stays there until we wake up.

<!-- We bought her a crate when we first brought her home, but she prefers the life of luxury instead; She sleeps on the couch in our living room, and around 5AM jumps into the bed with us (it's a habit she's formed over some time).
