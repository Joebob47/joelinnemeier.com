    <p> Jica has found her permanent home with us. Although we're prone to moving, she'll always be with us wherever we go. Currently her habitat is in downtown Santa Rosa, where our apartment is. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; She likes to roam the streets on leash, hike in places like Taylor Mountain, and roll around in all forms of grass and bush. But she can only really be herself off leash, like when she's chasing a frisbee in an open field.

<!-- My partner and I adopted Jica, so she's had a few homes in the past, but has found her permanent one with us. Currently we live in Santa Rosa, where there are plenty of parks, fields, and city sidewalks for her to explore.**pictures of Santa Rosa** If you want to get technical about it, her DNA details a mixture of many different breeds (ul here along with DNA breakdown). Therefore, the typical habitat of her breed may be in... **** pictures of Australia *****
